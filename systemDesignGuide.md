## 1. Preparing for System Design

### Understanding Key Concepts
- **Distributed Systems Principles**: Robustness, scalability, availability, performance, extensibility, resiliency.
- **Common Components**:
  - Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
  - Load Balancers
  - Caches
  - Firewalls
  - CDNs
  - Key-Value Stores
  - Messaging Queues
  - Rate Limiters
  - Blob Stores
  - Distributed Search
- **Trade-offs**: Strengths and weaknesses of design choices (e.g., eventual consistency vs. strict consistency).

### Refining Questions
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - What does the system need to do?
  - What are the core features and user interactions?
  - What are the SLAs (e.g., latency, availability)?
- **Nonfunctional Requirements**:
  - Scalability: How many users do we expect at launch? Peak?
  - Reliability: What’s the target uptime (e.g., 99.9%)?
  - Performance: Expected response time under load?
  - Privacy/Security: Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR)?
  - Maintenance: How easily should the system adapt to future changes?

## 2. Structure for Answering System Design Questions

### Step 1: Clarify Requirements
Start by asking clarifying questions to fully understand the problem:
- Who are the users? What actions will they take?
- What is the expected traffic (RPS, concurrent users)?
- Are there any special requirements (data consistency, geographic availability)?

### Step 2: Define High-Level Architecture
1. **Outline the system components**:
   - Front-end
   - API Gateway
   - Load Balancers
   - Service Layer (Application Servers)
   - Database (SQL/NoSQL)
   - Cache
   - CDNs
2. **Sketch a basic diagram**:
   - Use a hierarchical approach: Client → Web Servers → Application Servers → Databases.
3. **Explain data flow**:
   - How requests are handled from end to end.

### Step 3: Drill Down into Key Components
Focus on core components and their roles:
- **Database**:
  - SQL: Relational, supports ACID (e.g., for banking systems).
  - NoSQL: Key-value, document stores, or column-family for high write throughput.
  - Scalability: Sharding, replication.
- **Cache**:
  - In-memory stores like Redis or Memcached for frequent, low-latency reads.
- **Load Balancer**:
  - Horizontal scaling and distributing traffic.
  - Options: Layer 4 (TCP) vs. Layer 7 (HTTP) load balancers.
- **CDNs**:
  - Distribute static content globally to reduce latency.
- **Messaging Queues**:
  - RabbitMQ, Kafka for asynchronous communication between services.

### Step 4: Handle Data
Address critical data considerations:
- **Data Volume**:
  - Current size and expected growth rate.
  - Structured vs. unstructured data.
- **Data Operations**:
  - Is the workload read-heavy, write-heavy, or balanced?
  - What indexing strategies will optimize performance?
- **Consistency**:
  - CAP theorem trade-offs: Will eventual consistency suffice, or is strict consistency required?
- **Durability**:
  - How long should data persist, and under what circumstances?

### Step 5: Discuss Trade-offs
Acknowledge trade-offs and potential limitations in your design:
- **Availability vs. Consistency**:
  - E.g., eventual consistency in a highly available system like DNS.
- **Performance vs. Scalability**:
  - E.g., caching vs. real-time database queries.
- **Costs**:
  - E.g., hosting CDNs globally vs. limited regions.
Explain how your design addresses the **most critical requirements** given constraints.

### Step 6: Address Nonfunctional Requirements
Discuss these key metrics:
- **Scalability**:
  - Strategies for scaling up (vertical) or out (horizontal).
- **Reliability**:
  - Fault tolerance, replication, retries.
- **Latency**:
  - Optimal caching, database optimizations, CDN use.
- **Security**:
  - Encryption (at-rest and in-transit), authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT).
- **Monitoring**:
  - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana for metrics.
  - Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger or Zipkin.

### Step 7: Conclude with Enhancements
Discuss how you’d evolve the system in the future:
- **Scaling**:
  - Sharding databases, adding regions to CDNs.
- **Performance**:
  - Fine-tuning indexes, optimizing load balancers.
- **Resilience**:
  - Implementing circuit breakers, retries.
- **Observability**:
  - Improve logging, monitoring systems.

## 3. Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations
- **Traffic Estimation**:
  - E.g., For 10M monthly active users and 10 actions/user/day:
    - 10M x 10 = 100M actions/month.
    - ~38 actions/second on average.
- **Storage**:
  - E.g., If each action generates 1KB of data:
    - 100M x 1KB = 100GB/month.

## 4. Design Example Systems
Focus on classic problems:
1. **TinyURL**:
   - Requirements: Shorten URLs, redirect efficiently.
   - Components: Hashing for unique IDs, NoSQL for storing mappings.
2. **WhatsApp**:
   - Requirements: Real-time messaging, end-to-end encryption.
   - Components: WebSockets for real-time, distributed messaging queue.
3. **Twitter**:
   - Requirements: Post tweets, timeline ranking.
   - Components: Pub-Sub system for notifications, distributed database for tweets.
4. **Uber**:
   - Requirements: Match riders to drivers, real-time tracking.
   - Components: Geospatial database, distributed task scheduler.

## 5. Mistakes to Avoid
- Writing code: Focus on architecture, not implementation.
- Building without a plan: Start with requirements and high-level design.
- Working in silence: Talk through your reasoning.
- Ignoring trade-offs: Acknowledge weaknesses and constraints.
